(Hopefully) collaborative effort to argue to policy makers that games should not be killed.

## Rationale

Number one, [Stop Killing Games](https://www.stopkillinggames.com/). Read it.

Number two, [Louis Rossman's video](https://youtu.be/8wCLSCnOw9k?t=939) where he mentions that politicians don't
understand video games. It's true. It's our job to prepare documents that explain from scratch how videogames work and
not killing games is a good thing. If we won't do it, videogame industry lobbyists will.

## How to contribute

* Look at the issue list. Do things from there. This might be searching for data, writing documents, preparing graphics
  or screenshots.
  * Contribute however you want: pastebin, attaching documents, whatever. If you know how to use git, clone the
    repository and make pull requests, either for yourself or for other people.
* Brainstorm more ideas on forums. Suggest things to do.

## Initial TODOs (random and uncoordinated)

* Look at the ["Deere in the headlights"](https://pirg.org/edfund/resources/deere-in-the-headlights-3/) report to get
  the idea how a report explaining a thing to politicians should look like.
* Prepare a draft chapter that explains how multiplayer videogames work?
  * Videogames are programs that you run on a computer.
  * A server is a program that runs on your computer.
  * Clients talk to server and this is how multiplayer games operate.
  * A server can run on any computer.
* Prepare a draft chapter on online DRM.
* Look up statistics.
  * What percentage of games don't require a multiplayer server at all.
  * What percentage require a multiplayer server and what percentage were killed, by year.
  * What else?
* Search for success stories of games saved by their communities. Write how they happened.
* Document stories of games that "couldn't work offline" and which received an offline mode patch.
