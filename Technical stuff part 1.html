<span id="technical-stuff-part-1"></span><h1>Video games, multiplayer and servers<a class="headerlink" href="#video-games-multiplayer-and-servers" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>In order to get a picture of how hard or easy it is to support a server for a
video game, one needs to understand how online multiplayer works. This chapter
shows examples how a multiplayer game can work, and that it possible for a
community of players to support a game once a publisher ends official support.</p>
<p>Video games are, at their core, programs that a player runs on his computer.
They run their code on the machine, output graphics and sound and react to
player input. A simplest example would be a single player chess program: it
draws the chessboard on the screen, it reacts to the player inputting moves,
and it calculates and makes the move of a computer opponent.</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A video game that wants to support playing with other people over the Internet
needs to be able to connect to and talk to other games running on other
players’ computers. From a programmer’s point of view, the Internet is just
another input and output: the game sends messages out and reacts to messages
coming in. For example, two chess programs can talk over the Internet,
exchanging moves done by each player, each updating the state of the game
independently. This style of online multiplayer is called “peer-to-peer”. It is
used for example by the original first person shooter game “Doom”.</p>
<figure class="align-default" id="id18">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/chess_example_2.png"><img alt="_images/chess_example_2.png" src="_images/chess_example_2.png" style="width: 600px;" />
</a>
<figcaption>
<p><span class="caption-text">Simple “peer-to-peer” multiplayer</span><a class="headerlink" href="#id18" title="Link to this image">¶</a></p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Peer-to-peer is not the only way one can implement online multiplayer. In more
complex games and with many players, it is easier to have a sort of “referee”
or a “game master”: a separate program which keeps track of the game’s state
and which all other games talk to. Such a program is called a “server”, while
the games ran by the players that talk to this program are called “clients”.</p>
<figure class="align-default" id="id19">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/chess_example_3.png"><img alt="_images/chess_example_3.png" src="_images/chess_example_3.png" style="width: 600px;" />

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A server is a program ran on a computer, just like the video game. In simplest
cases the server program is just the game, just stripped of all the
player-facing components like graphics and player input. Because a server is
still just a program, it can run on any computer. It can, for example, run on a
player’s own computer, or on one rented from a hosting company.</p>
<p>Today’s AAA multiplayer video games often rely on multiple dedicated servers
that are much more complicated to setup that a single server program
described above. These can take different forms and be responsible for
different things, such as:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Databases which hold, update and serve player data,</p></li>
<li><p>Payment processing servers which talk to third-party payment services,</p></li>
<li><p>Game servers that manage game state, with their number dynamically scaled
using orchestration,</p></li>
<li><p>Servers used for Digital Rights Management,</p></li>
<li><p>Lobby and matchmaking servers,</p></li>
<li><p>Voice chat,</p></li>
<li><p>Game forums,</p></li>
<li><p>And more.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>However, the fundamentals of these complex sets of servers are the same: it is
a collection of programs that game clients send messages to and receive message
from. There’s nothing inherent about servers that requires the publisher
specifically to operate them. And so, some games for which the official servers
were shut down have been restored to a reasonably playable state by fan
communities.</p>
<section id="community-servers">
<h2>Community servers<a class="headerlink" href="#community-servers" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Some multiplayer games that require complex server infrastructure were
preserved by fan communities after the publisher ended support for multiplayer
components. Not all of these games became non-functional after support ended;
examples listed here serve as proof that such games can still be preserved and
maintained by fans.</p>

<h3>Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance<a class="headerlink" href="#supreme-commander-forged-alliance" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance is a real time strategy game released in
2007. The game supports peer-to-peer online multiplayer. Its developer, Gas
Powered Games, also operated a multiplayer service “GPGNet” which provided
matchmaking, downloading player-made maps and mods, chat, archive of past
multiplayer games and so on. GPGNet was shutdown in 2012. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id9" id="id1" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>1<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> Matchmaking
continued to be available through Steam, leaving the game in a playable state.</p>
<p>“FAForever” <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id10" id="id2" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>2<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> is a fan project which works as a replacement for GPGNet. It
provides matchmaking, player-made maps and mods, chat, past game archive, as
well as new services like improved peer-to-peer connectivity and proxy servers.
The server code is maintained by volunteers and runs on rented computers paid
for by community donations.</p>

<h3>City of Heroes<a class="headerlink" href="#city-of-heroes" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>City of Heroes is a multiplayer role playing game (MMORPG) released in 2004. It
operated until 2012 when the official servers were shut down. MMORPG servers
are especially difficult to recreate because they maintain a persistent game
word for hundreds of players, with much of game logic only calculated
server-side.</p>
<p>A fan implementation of the game’s server called “SCoRE” was developed in
secret since shutdown of the official servers, until its existence was leaked
in 2019. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id11" id="id3" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>3<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> There are multiple private servers operated using this fan
implementation, with the largest called “Homecoming” having over 100,000 total
players. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id12" id="id4" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>4<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> In 2024, developers of the “Homecoming” server were granted by
the publisher NCsoft an official license to host the game. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id13" id="id5" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>5<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>
<p>The “Homecoming” server developers operate multiple types of services,
including 7 map hosts, 4 high-availability database servers, spare servers to
handle failures, development infrastructure, forum, website, content delivery
network (CDN), as well as rented third party services such as an email service
and an SMS service. The infrastructure is supported by donations from the
community. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id14" id="id6" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>6<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>

<h3>Battleforge<a class="headerlink" href="#battleforge" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Battleforge is an online-only real time strategy game released by Electronic
Arts in 2009. Official servers have been shut down in 2013, making the game
inoperable. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id15" id="id7" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>7<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>
