When a player buys a video game, usually he pays a one time fee to be able to
play it. In the 2000s and before, this meant buying a physical copy of the game
on a medium like a floppy disk, a cartridge or a CD. While the player was
only licensed the copy of the game and did not own any rights to the game
itself, there was no limitation as to when the game could be played. As long as
the player had the hardware that was able to run the game, he could install and
play the game on his computer or console.

Today, many games both with and without multiplayer component connect to servers
ran by the game's publisher, either for multiplayer functionality or as part of
the game's Digital Rights Management (DRM). If the server is unavailable, the
games often do not allow the player to play it. If the publisher decides to shut
down the servers a game connects to, it can no longer be played. Many games are
never updated to work without a publisher's server. Additionally, DRM schemes
often make it impossible for players to fix their games so that they can work
without a server. Out of such "shut down" games catalogued by the "Stop Killing
Games" initiative, 63% of the games were never restored by players. [1]_

End user license agreements (EULA) for some modern video games contain clauses
that reserve the right by the publisher to terminate the agreement at any time.
The EULA for Ubisoft's racing game "The Crew 2" states that:

  Termination by UBISOFT will be effective [...] at the time of UBISOFTâ€™s
  decision to discontinue offering and/or supporting the Product. [2]_

However, a player that buys a game for a one time fee expects the game to
function like a book or a movie on a disk, i.e. a good. He expects his copy
of the game to be playable at any time in the future as long as he has the right
hardware, just like games sold two or more decades ago on physical media.
Alternatively, should sale of the game be considered a service like a movie
ticket, video game EULAs almost never specify at the moment of sale for how
long a video game will be supported by the publisher. Ubisoft's racing game "The
Crew" was sold all the way until December 2023, when Ubisoft announced the
game's shutdown four months later. [3]_

[TODO: better legal justification for good/service argument]

Today's video game terms of sale make them neither a good which a customer can
keep forever, nor a service that the customer knows the duration of. This
unclear status hurts customers, who buy video games expecting them to be goods,
but whose games can (and often do) get broken by the publisher whenever it
decides to shut down its servers. This report argues that [TODO I'm not
satisfied with these points]:

* The main issue is that publishers do not design their video games to still
  work after the publisher's servers are shut down,
* It is not difficult or expensive for a publisher to design a game so that it
  can still reasonably work after its "end of life",
* The publisher is not harmed by designing a game in such a way,
* Mandating by law that games should be left in a reasonably playable state
  after their end of life will solve the problem.
